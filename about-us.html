<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
The <em>BibleRICH</em> project is Christian and teaches Bible doctrine. It is our hope
that all who want to know where verses, people, places, and events are in the Bible
will have their heart's desires fulfilled, as we have, by employing <em>BibleRICH</em>.

<p>
Our mission is to give the Christian world simple and easy ways to remember
where verses, persons, places, and events are in the Holy Bible.

<p>
One morning in July of 2007 the creator of <em>BibleRICH</em>, Johanna, awoke with a start.  A voice was speaking to her.  "You don't know where Sodom and Gomorrah is," it said.  Johanna was shocked as she began to realize the truth of the statement -- she had no idea where the story of Sodom and Gomorrah could be found in the Bible.  She immediately decided that she needed to find all of the major events of the Bible and memorize their location by book and chapter.  After memorizing about 25 events,
Johanna asked her daughter to quiz her on her newly acquired knowledge.  To Johanna's dismay, her daughter asked her about events the locations of which she had not memorized.  This prompted her to memorize the highlights of every Bible chapter.  Johanna devised a way to easily remember where people, places, and events were in the Bible by summarizing chapters and associating them with creative clues.  As Johanna began to find and learn these chapter highlights, her daughter joined her in her
quest for memorization.
</p>

<p>
As both Johanna and her daughter began to learn these chapter highlights, it was not long before their friends began to notice their newly acquired knowledge.  Soon these friends asked Johanna if she could teach them, as well.  In response, Johanna began a class called <em>The RICH (Remember Important Chapter Highlights) Class</em>.
</p>

<p>
While teaching a youth version of one of these <em>RICH</em> classes in 2008, Johanna found that her students had trouble armed only with short words and clues.  This gave Johanna an idea -- she could draw a picture with the chapter number to aid with memorization.  The idea worked; students found associating each chapter with a picture very helpful.
</p>

<p>
Soon it was apparent that many people wanted to be able to access <em>The RICH Class's</em> resources online.  If <em>The RICH Class</em> was going to be incorporated into a website, it would need a more appropriate name -- thus, <em>BibleRICH</em> was born.
</p>

<p>
Another popular request was for similar memory aids for different topics -- not just each and every chapter.  To meet this request, Johanna began teaching a class using her drawings of specific verses and their locations.  It is our hope and dream to make all of <em>BibleRICH</em> available online in many different languages so that all can be <em>BibleRICH</em> and happy.
