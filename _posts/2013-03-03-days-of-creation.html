</p>
<p>
The top right hand corner of the picture page has the picture of Genesis Chapter 1 so you can see
that the creation days are the details of God speaking the days into existence and telling Adam
and Eve and the animals their diet. The little 1 is drawn to represent God standing and speaking
the days into creation and the diet.

<dl>
  <dt>Day 1</dt>
  <dd>yellow, for light - it travels in a straight line, like a 1. It is said that this light is like
  electricity or lightning that is throughout the universe.
  </dd>
  <dt>Day 2</dt>
  <dd>blue, for the color of the sky in the firmament (including air) space and waters that God
  divided. You can think of the 2 as looking like air swirling, a cloud, or a wave.
  </dd>
  <dt>Day 3</dt>
  <dd>green, for land and trees. The 3 is part of the tree, which is used to represent vegetation.
  Three and tree rhyme also, which makes it easy to remember.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
[think - God made three areas: light (like electricity in the universe), the firmament (from
dividing the waters), and the land and trees (vegetation) on days 1, 2, and 3. Now, He fills them in
days 4, 5, and 6. The colors also match. The first letters of these words light, firmamemt, land,
make a good acronym of l, f, l, (for days 1, 2, and 3) and l, f, l (for days 4, 5, and 6 ) - the same
acronym for both sets]
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Day 4</dt>
  <dd>yellow, for lights - sun, moon and two stars - their light also travels in a straight line
  like the straight lines of a 4. The four corners of the 4 are where the sun, moon and two stars are
  drawn, to help you picture them in your mind. They are up in the sky, like up on the top part of
  the 4.
  </dd>
  <dt>Day 5</dt>
  <dd>blue, for the color we think of for air and water where fish and fowl live. The top of the 5 is
  a fowl (bird) and the bottom of the 5 is a fish.
  </dd>
  <dt>Day 6</dt>
  <dd>brown, the color in many land animals and man. Giraffes have long necks like the top
  line of the 6, so a giraffe is drawn here to represent animals. The bottom circle of the 6 is made
  into a man's head with a body also drawn to represent man.
  The book highlight is heaven and earth, so they are placed after day 3 because that is where God
  gathered the waters under the heaven together in one place and let the dry land appear and put
  vegetation on it. So the earth is draw with what the earth looked like at that point.
