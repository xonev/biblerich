  I recommend the BibleRICH program not only for everyone to memorize
  scripture but for a better understanding of the scriptures, and it's a great tool to give Bible studies.

  <p>
  All these years I could never recite the books of the Bible, when even the little
  ones could, and now I can with BibleRICH.

  The BibleRICH class is comprehensive with clear understanding and deeply

  <p>
  BibleRICH is an interesting and easy way to remember important
  chapter highlights! An excellent sharing tool for people of all ages. Diligence and discipline are
  required, but there is no better way to spend time than to be studying God's word. Thank you. It
  has been a great blessing!

  BibleRICH is very good. I enjoy it very much. You memorize the highlights
  of the Bible chapters. I would tell everyone to do this, especially for the end of time.

  I had long given up on learning and retaining Scripture when I discovered
  this amazing memorization plan. What a joy it is to put my finger right where a particular event
  or topic is presented in God's Word!

  <p>
  BibleRICH has been a truly "enRICHing" experience for me. As I
  started memorizing scripture I realized at the same time that I need to know the Bible better and
  for this I have to study it more. That way, BibleRICH has not just been a big motivation for me
  to get more into scripture memorization, but has also been a big blessing for my spiritual life.

  BibleRICH has been such a blessing in my life. It has helped me to learn the
  whole book of Daniel.

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Joining the BibleRICH class was one of the best memorizing classes I have
  ever taken. I hesitated to join the class thinking I was too busy and maybe too old to memorize
  anymore. But I found that neither one of those were true! I also found it to be an excellent review
  of the Bible. What I really enjoy doing is greeting a classmate with, "Two go up, two come
  down", and she says, "Genesis 22."

  I thank the Lord for BibleRICH. "Pictures are worth a thousand
  words." Verses in pictures becomes easier to remember and recall. I am indeed blessed with
  BibleRICH, so if you have not used it, try it, and you will be blessed too.

  <p>
  A very excellent program! It's convenient to teach you where the stories
  are of the Bible. I love it and it's a very wonderful learning tool. It's a perfect way to teach
  children and I will be teaching it to my granddaughter. I know it will be very successful in the
  end of time, thanks to you, BibleRICH.

  <p>
  It was a blessing to encounter the memorization program,
  BibleRICH. For a long time I tried memorizing Bible verses. I now realize that this visual
  method is excellent to bring to mind a lot of verses from the Holy Scriptures. I enjoy using it.

<blockquote>
  <p>
  I was blessed to find this memorization plan for the Bible just when the
  class was embarking on Daniel and Revelation. This method of learning about the Bible has
  rekindled my interest in studying the amazing accuracy of Bible prophecies and so much more!
  It has also given me more confidence when sharing God's Word with others.

<blockquote>
  <p>
  I want to praise the Lord that I was there when the class started with the books
  of Genesis, Exodus, etc. I was especially blessed by Daniel and Revelation. God has
  tremendously blessed me by the way BibleRICH is taught. It makes the Bible come alive and not
  just a book.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  BibleRICH has given me a new way of looking at story
  events and prophesy. I can identify the books and occurrences via the pictures a lot faster. The
  images help me to recall the words.

<blockquote>
  <p>
  BibleRICH has blessed me in so many ways. It has helped me to remember the
  Word of God more easily by picturing it in my mind. It has also helped me to see Christ
  throughout the Old Testament. He is our Creator (John 1 - Genesis 1). He is the Living Bread
  (John 6 - Exodus 16). He is the Lamb (John 1 - Isaiah 53), and more.

  <p>
  BibleRICH pictures stimulate my mind to think more about the last days and
  motivates me for more study. It helped me to see how the gift of art can be used to memorize
  scripture.

  I have not taken the class, but one afternoon the producer explain the Matthew
  28:19 picture to me. The next morning the picture just popped in my mind. It really does work!
