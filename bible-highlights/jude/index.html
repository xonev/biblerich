<h1>Jude - Person Falling</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>””content for the faith which was</p>
<p>once delivered unto the saints</p>
<p>” 1:3 “Sodom and Gomorrha. . .</p>
<p>suffering the vengeance of</p>
<p>eternal fire</p>
<p>” 1:7 “Yet, Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about t</p>
<p>he body of Moses</p>
<p>” 1:9 “and others save with fear,</p>
<p>pulling them out of the fire</p>
<p>” 1:23 “Now unto Him that is able to</p>
<p>keep you from falling</p>
<p>” 1:24</p>
<p>You can think of the body falling as the faith being delivered down to the saints, as it is coming down.</p>
<p>To remember Jude is where the Bibles says Sodom and Gomorrha was burnt up with eternal fire, the body is drawn black and curved up like smoke like it is being burnt up. It also looks like a body is being pulled out of a fire for verse 23.</p>
<p>To remember Jude is where the Bible says Moses’ body was raised up, you can again think of the falling man as being pulled up out of the grave and being black because Moses was dead. Of course, Moses got a new body.</p>
<p>(the person falling down is made in a curved line and a J can be made with the back part of the body for the J in Jude)</p>
<p>(to remember there is 1 chapter in Jude a 1 can be made with the back part of the body and the little line at the bottom of the 1 at the feet of the person, and there is 1 person drawn for 1 chapter in Jude)</p>
