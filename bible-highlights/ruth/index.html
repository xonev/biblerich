<h1>Ruth </h1>
<p>said, Entreat me not to leave thee. . . for whither thou goest, I will go. . . thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.” 1:16 </p>
<p>(the lines on the top of Ruth’s headdress make an R for Ruth) </p>
<p>(you can think of either the 2 lines going down and the one going across at the top of Ruth’s headdress or the two lines going down of her back and stomach and the line going across her waist as the 4 in 4 chapters in Ruth)</p>
