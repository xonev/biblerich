<h1>Joel </h1>
<p>the son of Pethuel” 1:1, “The </p>
<p>sun </p>
<p>and the</p>
<p> moon </p>
<p>shall be </p>
<p>dark </p>
<p>and the </p>
<p>stars</p>
<p> shall </p>
<p>withdraw their shining</p>
<p> . . . The </p>
<p>sun </p>
<p>shall be turned into </p>
<p>darkness,</p>
<p> and the </p>
<p>moon</p>
<p> into </p>
<p>blood”</p>
<p> 2:10 & 31, “The </p>
<p>sun</p>
<p> and the </p>
<p>moon</p>
<p> shall be </p>
<p>darkened</p>
<p>, and the </p>
<p>stars </p>
<p>shall withdraw their shining” 3:15</p>
<p>(the moon can be made into a J for Joel, also when you look at the sun, moon, and star it almost looks like the o-e-l of Joel)</p>
<p>(to help you remember there are 3 chapter in Joel, 3 things are drawn 1. the sun, 2. the moon, and 3. the stars, and they are mentioned 3 times in Joel as being darkened with 1 mentioning the moon being darkened by turning into blood, so it has been drawn with a little bit of red on it)</p>
<p>(Joel is the 2nd book of the O’s and has the circle O’s of the sun, moon, and inside & outside of the star)</p>
