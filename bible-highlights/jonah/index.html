<h1>Jonah </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>fish </p>
<p>-“Now the LORD had prepared a </p>
<p>great fish</p>
<p> to swallow up J</p>
<p>onah.</p>
<p> And Jonah was in the belly of the f</p>
<p>ish </p>
<p>three days and three nights.” 1:17</p>
<p>(the top of the tail line and the bottom of the body can be made into a J for Jonah, and you can think of the J for Jonah also as a hook to catch a fish)</p>
<p>(to remember there is 4 chapters in Jonah, where the body and tail of the fish make an x can be made into a 4 for 4 chapters in Jonah)</p>
<p>(Jonah is the 5th and last book of the O’s and has the circle O in the body of the fish)</p>
