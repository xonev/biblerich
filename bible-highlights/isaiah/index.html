<h1>Isaiah</h1>
<p> . . . 1:1, “Above it stood the </p>
<p>seraphims</p>
<p>: each one had </p>
<p>six wings</p>
<p>; with </p>
<p>twain he covered his face</p>
<p>, and with </p>
<p>twain he covered his feet</p>
<p>, and with </p>
<p>twain he did fly.</p>
<p>” 6:2</p>
<p>(either of the two long side lines of the angel can be made into the long I for Isaiah)</p>
<p>(you can think that the Isaiah angel is covering his eyes for the I sound in Isaiah)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 66 chapter in Isaiah,  6 points of the feathers are drawn on the bottom of the angel with 6 wings, which is in chapter 6 of Isaiah)</p>
