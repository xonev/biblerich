<h1>Philippians</h1>
<p> - </p>
<p>flag</p>
<p> </p>
<p>on land </p>
<p>- “To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at </p>
<p>Philippi </p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>Being confident </p>
<p>of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you </p>
<p>will perform it” </p>
<p>1:1, 6,</p>
<p>“that I may </p>
<p>win </p>
<p>Christ” 3:8, </p>
<p> “</p>
<p>rejoice </p>
<p>in the Lord alway; and again I say </p>
<p>Rejoice.</p>
<p> . . I can </p>
<p>do all things </p>
<p>through Christ which </p>
<p>strengtheneth me</p>
<p>. . . my God shall </p>
<p>supply all your need</p>
<p>” 4:4, 13, 19</p>
<p>The encyclopedia says that Philippi was the scene of the victory by Mark Antony over Brutus in 42 B.C.,  and that the book Philippians is noted for its generally joyful tone and that I may win Christ, so a victory flag is used for the highlight of Philippians.</p>
<p>The victory flag fits Philippians because many of the familiar verses in Philippians give an air of victory and joy.</p>
<p>“Philippians” even says “fill up” or “fill lips” to remember Philippians is about “filling up” with confidence, finished work, rejoicing, strength, and supplies, and “filling lips” with rejoicing, etc.</p>
<p>Philippians is the 6th of the 9 books written by Paul to a group of people in a place, Philippi, with the books so named, so the flag is drawn on land.</p>
<p>(the pole on the flag can be made into the left line of the P for Philippians and drawing a circle around the flag makes the top circle of the P in Philippians)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 4 chapters in Philippians the flag can be made into a backwards 4 by the pole making the line going down of a 4 and the angle of the flag as the top angle of a 4 for 4 chapters in Philippians)  </p>
