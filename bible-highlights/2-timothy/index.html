<h1>2 Timothy - Toddler</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>”To</p>
<p>Timothy, my dearly beloved son</p>
<p>” 1:2, “And that from a</p>
<p>child</p>
<p>thou hast known the holy scriptures” 3:15</p>
<p>Since Paul thought of Timothy as his own son and this second letter was written later, and this is where it says that as a child Timothy knew the scriptures, a toddler is used as the highlight for 2 Timothy.</p>
<p>(the left side line of the toddler can be made into the line going down of a T for Timothy and the bottom line of the toddler’s face can be made into the line going across of a T for Timothy; and then the feet can be made into the bottom of the “i” in Timothy and the hand can be made into the dot)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 4 chapters in 2 Timothy the left side line of the toddler can be made into the left side line of a 4 for 4 chapters and the bottom line of the toddler’s legs can be made into the line going across of a 4 and a line can be drawn straight down from his hands to make the right line of a 4 for 4 chapters in 2 Timothy)</p>
