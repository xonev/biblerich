<h1>Psalms - Music Note Stem Down</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>“I will</p>
<p>sing</p>
<p>of the mercies of the Lord forever” 89:1</p>
<p>Psalm means a spiritual song, so a note is used.</p>
<p>(the music note is drawn with the stem down to make the letter “P” for Psalms)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 150 chapters in Psalms, think of the line of the note for the 1, the circle of the note for the bottom of the 5 and the dot for the 0 in 150 chapters in Psalms)</p>
