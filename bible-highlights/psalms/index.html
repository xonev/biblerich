<h1>Psalms </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>music note stem down </p>
<p>-“I will </p>
<p>sing</p>
<p> of the mercies of the Lord forever” 89:1</p>
<p>Psalm means a spiritual song, so a note is used.</p>
<p>(the music note is drawn with the stem down to make the letter “P” for Psalms) </p>
<p>(to remember there are 150 chapters in Psalms, think of the line of the note for the 1, the circle of the note for the bottom of the 5 and the dot for the 0 in 150 chapters in Psalms)</p>
