<h1>Numbers - Number Sign</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p> “So he</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>ed them in the wilderness of Sinai” 1:19.</p>
<p>Numbers is also about the</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>of adventures of this large</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>of people that Moses led for a large</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>of years.</p>
<p>You can think of the number sign also as bars of a prison, for the people no going into the promise land and were punished (like in prison) to wonder in the wilderness for 40 years. This begins in chapter 14.</p>
<p>(the 2 lines down in the number sign you can think of as the two sides of an N for Numbers)</p>
<p>(the number sign makes 3 squares on the top row for the 3 in 36 chapters and the middle and bottom row make 6 squares for 36 chapters in Numbers)</p>
