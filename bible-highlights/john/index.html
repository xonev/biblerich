<h1>John </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>hands creating & giving to world</p>
<p> - </p>
<p>“All things were made </p>
<p>by him . . . For God so loved the </p>
<p>world</p>
<p> that he </p>
<p>gave</p>
<p> his only begotten Son” 1:3, 3:16</p>
<p>John is the 4th of the 4 gospels and portrays Jesus as God, so hands making & holding the world, and God giving the world his Son is used for the highlight of John.</p>
<p>(the left side of the hands can be made into a J for John, the circle of the world can be made into the “o” in John, the right hand fingers can be made into an “h” and an “n” in John)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 21 chapters in John the circle of the world can be made into the top circle shape of a 2 for 21 chapters and the right side line of the hands can be made into a 1 for the 1 in 21 chapters in John)</p>
