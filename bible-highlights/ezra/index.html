<h1>Ezra</h1>
<p>, after the wisdom of thy God, </p>
<p>that is in thine hand</p>
<p>, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye they that know them not.‚Äù 7:11, 13, 23 </p>
<p>Many letters were written in Ezra, especially this one in chapter 7 from Artaxerxes, to restore Jerusalem, marking the beginning of the 2300 days, so an envelope is used with a hand holding it for the highlight of Ezra) </p>
<p>(the left line of the envelope and the top & bottom line of the envelope make the side and top & bottom line on the letter E for Ezra) </p>
<p>(to remember there are 10 chapters in Ezra think of the left side of the envelope for the 1 and the circle of the hand for the 0)</p>
