<h1>1 Timothy</h1>
<p> - </p>
<p>baby</p>
<p> -“Unto </p>
<p>Timothy, my own son</p>
<p> in the faith” 1:2, “ Let no man despise thy </p>
<p>youth</p>
<p>” 4:12, “For </p>
<p>we brought nothing into this world</p>
<p>, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.” 6:7</p>
<p>Since Paul thought of Timothy as his own son, and this is where is says we brought nothing into this world which would be as a baby, a baby is used as the highlight for 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>(the line in the middle of the baby that makes the blanket can be made into the bottom part of a T for Timothy and the top left side line of the baby can be made into the top of a T for Timothy; and the circle of the baby can also be made into the dot of the “i” in Timothy)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 6 chapters in 1 Timothy the circle of the baby can be drawn as the bottom of a 6 for 6 chapters in 1 Timothy)</p>
