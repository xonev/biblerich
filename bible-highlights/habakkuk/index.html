<h1>Habakkuk</h1>
<p> the prophet did see . . . I raise up the </p>
<p>Chaldeans (Babylon)</p>
<p>. . . which shall </p>
<p>march </p>
<p>through the breadth of the land, to possess” 1:1, 6</p>
<p>(since Babylon is given the head of gold on the image in Daniel 2, this marching Babylon soldier is dressed in gold color to remember he is from Babylon in the shape of an H for Habakkuk)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 3 chapters in Habakkuk think of the soldier’s 2 legs marching and his 1 arm holding out his sword - 3 things going out as actions of his body for 3 chapters in Habakkuk)</p>
<p>(there are also 3 “k’s” in Habakkuk for the 3 chapters in Habakkuk)</p>
