<h1>Ephesians - 1st Church (In Revelation) By Sea</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p> “Unto the angel of the</p>
<p>church of Ephesus</p>
<p>write” Revelation 2:1</p>
<p>“to the saints which are at</p>
<p>Ephesus</p>
<p>. . . who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings</p>
<p>in heavenly places</p>
<p>. . . and set him at his own right hand</p>
<p>in the heavenly places”</p>
<p>1:1, 3, 20, “And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together</p>
<p>in heavenly places”</p>
<p>2:6, “the principalities and powers</p>
<p>in heavenly places</p>
<p>” 3:10, “spiritual wickedness</p>
<p>in high places</p>
<p>” 6:12</p>
<p>In Revelation, Ephesus is one of the churches a letter is written to, so a church is used as the highlight of Ephesus. And since Ephesus is the 1st church in Revelation the number 1 with “st” is put on the top of the building.</p>
<p>Ephesus is on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea so a church representing Ephesus is drawn on the right side of the sea.</p>
<p>Since “in heavenly places ” is mentioned 4 times &amp; only in Ephesians, it was used as part of the highlight represented by the blue cloud and the 3 birds above the church.  As it would follow, “spiritual wickedness in  high places” is also in Ephesians.</p>
<p>Ephesians is the 5th of the 9 books written by Paul to a group of people in a place, Ephesus, with the book so named, so land is drawn.</p>
<p>(the left side line of the house along with the top and bottom line of the house can make the left, top, &amp; bottom line of an E for Ephesians, and the top line of the door can make the middle line going across of an E for Ephesians)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 6 chapters in Ephesian the land going around the church can be made into a 6 for 6 chapters in Ephesians)</p>
