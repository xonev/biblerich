<h1>2 Chronicles - 2 Roll Scroll With 36</h1>

<p> “ And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah . . . are they not</p>
<p>written in the book of the chronicles</p>
<p>of the kings of Judah?” 2 Kings 20:20</p>
<p>(2 Chronicles is about the generations from Solomon to Zedekiah, to help you remember this the 3 on the left can be made into an S for Solomon and the top of the 6 can be made into a Z for Zedekiah)</p>
<p>(the Chronicles’ kings then look like this: 1 Chronicles  A-D, 2 Chronicles S-Z, which are in Alphabetical Order)</p>
<p>(2 roll scroll is drawn so you know you are in 2 Chronicles)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 36 chapters in 2 Chronicles, the ends of the scroll are made into a 3 and a 6,</p>
<p>and the left side of the 6 can be thought of as the shape of a “C” for Chronicles</p>
