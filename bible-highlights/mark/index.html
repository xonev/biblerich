<h1>Mark - Towel</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p> “The sabbath was</p>
<p>made for man,</p>
<p>and not man for the sabbath” 2:27</p>
<p>Mark is the 2nd of the 4 gospels and portrays Jesus as Servant, so a towel is used for the highlight of Mark because Jesus served the disciples by washing their feet and used a towel.</p>
<p>(the left side of the towel can be made into the left side of an M for Mark, the top and right line of the towel can be used to make the middle line of an M for Mark, and an additional line can be drawn to the right to make the right side of an M for Mark)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 16 chapters in Mark the left line of the towel can be made into a 1 for the 1 in 16 chapters and the right line of the towel with it curving at the bottom can be made into a 6)</p>
