<p>“</p>
<p>Joshua</p>
<p>said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hast given you the city. . . So . . . the people shouted with a great shout, that the</p>
<p>wall fell down flat</p>
<p>” 6:16, 20</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is where the wall falls down flat, so the wall is drawn flat to make the bottom of a 6 and the scarlet thread that saved Rahab is drawn to make the top of the 6.</p>
<p>(the scarlet thread is made into a J for Joshua)</p>
<p>(the scarlet thread can look like a 2 for the 2 in the 24 chapters of Joshua and the outside walls as the two side lines of a</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>in 2</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>chapters)</p>
