<h1>Matthew </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>M-a-t-t-h-e-w crown</p>
<p> - “there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born </p>
<p>King </p>
<p>of the Jews?” 2:2</p>
<p>Matthew is the 1st of the 4 gospels and portrays Jesus as King, so a crown is used for the highlight of Matthew.</p>
<p>(the top of the crown spells out M-A-T-T-H-E-W for Matthew)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 28 chapters in Matthew the left line of the crown can be made into a 2 for the 2 in 28 chapters and there are 7 letters in the name Matthew at the top of the crown plus the 1 line drawn at the bottom to make the crown which is 7+1=8 for the 8 in 28 chapters) </p>
