<h1>James </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>front end loader</p>
<p> -”faith with out </p>
<p>works</p>
<p> is dead” 2:20, “to him that knoweth </p>
<p>to do good</p>
<p>, and </p>
<p>doeth</p>
<p> it not, to him it is sin.” 4:17</p>
<p>Since these important and familiar verses are in James, a gold colored front end loader is used to represent working and doing. The gold color is used to indicate the works come from heavenly help.</p>
<p>(the curved front end scoop and arm on the left of the front end loader can be made into a J for James)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 5 chapters in James the top line of the engine of the front end loader can be made into the top line of the 5 in 5 chapters and the curved front scoop and arm on the left of the front end loader can be made into the line going down and the half circle of a 5 for 5 chapters in James)</p>
