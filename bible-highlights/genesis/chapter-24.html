<h1>Genesis 24</h1>

{% include picture-page-header.html %}

<p>The big 2 is made into Rebekah with her skirt also flowing in the bottom of the 2.</p>
<p>The big 4 is made into the well that Rebekah draws the water from for Abrahamâ€™s servant and his camels, which answered his prayer.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:24 tells about marriage, that a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be 1 flesh. Genesis 24 is also about a marriage using the same numbers of the chapter and verse of Genesis 2, so it is easy to relate and remember the 2 together.</p>
<p>The book highlight is heaven &amp; earth so the earth is placed under Genesis 2:24 where God tells how marriage is between a man &amp; a woman on the earth.</p>
