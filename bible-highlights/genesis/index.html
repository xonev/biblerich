<p> heaven and earth</p>
<p> -“In the beginning God created the </p>

<p>and the </p>
<p>earth</p>
<p>.” 1:1 (the circle of the earth can be made into the circle of a G for Genesis) </p>
<p>(the curved line of the heaven can be made into the top line of the 5 for 50 chapters in Genesis and the circle of the earth can make the bottom circle of a 5 and the earth again you can think of as the 0 for the 50) </p>
