<h1>Genesis 29</h1>

{% include picture-page-header.html %}

<p>Laban and Leah deceive Jacob and he marries Leah instead of Rachel. Jacob also marries Rachel in this chapter. The big 2 is made into a lady bride to represent Leah and Rachel, Jacob’s 2 brides he gets in chapter 29, which is written at the bottom of the bride.</p>
<p>Leah bares Jacob’s first four sons in this chapter. The first letters of Leah’s four sons are drawn curving with the shape of the big 9. Under the 9 the phrase ‘Royal Seed Line of Jesus’ is written which can help you remember the names: Royal - Reuben, Seed - Simeon, Line - Levi,  (of) Jesus - Judah. Line and nine (9) also rhyme to help you remember the royal seed <strong>line</strong> of Jesus is in chapter 2<strong>9</strong>.</p>
<p>At the top left the oldest, the 1st born to Leah was Reuben, so a number “1” is placed at the top of his name. Since the acronym for Reuben is Royal, a crown is drawn over his name to represent the royal seed line was supposed to go to him because he was the 1st born, so you can think of the number 1 royalty to go together.  God could not give it to Reuben because he sleeps with Rachel’s handmade, Bilhah, in chapter 35. Since Rue means “looked”  or “behold,” something with the eyes, the word is shortened to the basic understanding that it has to do with the eyes to “see.” Since Ben means “son,” a man’s head to represent “a son” is drawn by Rueben’s name with his eyes looking up to represent  the definition, “see.”</p>
<p>To the right is the 2nd son born - Simeon. A little 2 is drawn with a seed at the top and a man’s head at the bottom to help you remember the 2nd son’s acronym is Seed.  Another 2 is drawn into a pair of ears to help you remember that Simeon means “heard” or “hearing,” so the word is shortened to the basic understanding that it has to do with the ears to “hear.” For easy association with seed for Simeon and hearing, you can think ears of corn have lots of seed kernels on them, and also think, you can not really hear seeds.</p>
<p>Going down the big 9 is the 3rd son - Levi. This dark blue color for his name is used for two reasons. One is so you can associate the color of Levi with some jeans</p>
<p>called Levi jeans that we think of as dark blue. And the second reason is because blue represents loyalty and the Levites redeem themselves after their father, Levi, and Simeon give up the birthright being passed down to them by slaughtering the “just circumcised” men of Shechem in Genesis 34. God appoints the Levites to be the priests of the sanctuary because of what they did in Exodus 32. They were the only tribe that would gather together with Moses and became loyal to God to slay all those opposed to God after they had made the golden calf. The acronym for Levi is Line, so there are three lines drawn to the right of Levi to represent Levi being the 3rd born and to represent these first 3 sons giving up the line of Jesus coming through them. Levi means “joined,” so you can think of these 3 lines as the 1st 3 sons as being joined together in doing evil, yet on the other hand God joins this 3rd line of Levites to join or be connected with him in the prized, honorable and beloved sanctuary service.  The 3 lines you can also think of for kind of as the shape of the sanctuary in a rectangle. For simplicity, the word joined is shortened to the basic understanding of “join.”</p>
<p>At the bottom of the big 9 is the 4th - Judah. Judah is especially visible, written in red, because this is the line (birthright) that Jesus comes through. A little 4 is placed to the right of Judah because Judah did right in Genesis 37 in proposing not to kill Joseph, and in Genesis 43 he becomes surety for Benjamin and will take the blame if he returns him not to his father, and again in Genesis 44 when Judah pleads with Joseph to let them be servants to take the blame for the cup being found in Benjamin’s bag. When Joseph says no, then Judah pleads to let him stay in Benjamin’s place, but let Benjamin go back to his father, Jacob or his father would die. So Judah established right behavior and the line of Jesus went to him. This makes it easy to remember the acronym for Judah is Jesus. The little person on the right of the 4 represents Jesus and the line going across to the right to Jesus you can think of as the 4th line, as opposed to the 3 in Levi’s picture, gets to have the birthright. You can think of the arrows going up on the 4 for the definition of Judah which means “praise,” and that the lines are going up in praise to God and Jesus on the little 4. Since 4 means creation, you can also think that the line of Jesus, our creator and who will create this earth anew, was going to come through Judah.</p>
<p>There are 3 major words that start with an “L” about this chapter to help you remember what is in it - Laban, Leah, and line. And they are in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The book highlight is heaven &amp; earth so they are drawn by ‘Judah’ because this is the line that Jesus comes through on the earth.</p>
