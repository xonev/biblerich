<h1>Genesis 35</h1>

<p>A 3 looks like a “B” for Buried &amp; Benjamin, if you just add 1 line to it on the left. “B” and “R” are similar if you take the bottom line off the “B.”  There are many “R” words in this chapter and some have “b’s” in them as you can see on the top right - (ear)Rings, Re<strong>b</strong>ekah, Rachel, Rue<strong>b</strong>en. These “R” words,  two with “b” in them, plus Isaac’s death are the 5 burials in this chapter and they happen in order from smallest to largest. The first is jewelry, the next 2 things are ladies, and the last two things are men. So, you can think 1, 2, and 2 kinds of things are buried for easy recall. We will explain each burial by the number order in which they happened.</p>
<p>First, the little 3’s on the left 1st 4 pictures are made into a “B” for Buried.</p>
<h4>Burial 1 (jewelry).</h4>
<p>The top of the first little 5 on the left is an oak tree and the bottom is an (ear)Ring Buried underneath. Here is where you can also think of the little 5 as a $ (a dollar sign) because they bury some of their jewelry, which was worth a lot, under the oak tree.</p>
<h4>Burial 2 (lady).</h4>
<p>The bottom of the second little 5 on the left is made into the grave of Rebekah’s nurse, Buried and the top of the 5 is made into an oak tree where she was buried.</p>
<h4>Burial 3 (lady).</h4>
<p>The main thing in this chapter is Rachel dies baring Benjamin, so we used the big 35 in the middle of this page. The top half circle of the big 3 is the head and the bottom half circle is the body to represent Benjamin being born and it is also made into a “B” for buried because Rachel dies while bearing him. The bottom of the big 5 is Rachel buried, a grave, and the top of the 5 shows that it was while on their way to Bethlehem.</p>
<h4>Burial 4 (man).</h4>
<p>The top of the third little 5 on the left is Reuben laying down to represent him laying with Bilhah. In a sense, this “Buried” his birthright. So the bottom of the third little 5 is made into a baby boy to represent his birthright being buried.</p>
<h4>Burial 5 (man).</h4>
<p>The top of the fourth little 5 on the left is drawn into Isaac laying down, dying and the bottom of the fourth little 5 is him Buried in the cave in Canaan. You can remember Isaac’s age by adding up the numbers of this chapter 35, 3+5=8, to get the 8 in 180 years old.</p>
<p>The little 3 at the center bottom of the page is made into  a “B“ for Blessing to Jacob of all the land of the earth (which is made out of the bottom of the little 5) promised to Abraham &amp; Isaac, God would give it to him. The top of the little 5 is God’s hand giving it to him. God also told him, for the 2nd time, that his name was changed from Jacob to Israel. The book highlight is heaven &amp; earth so they are drawn in this little 5 at the bottom center because the land promised to Jacob was all the land promised to Abraham &amp; Isaac on the earth.</p>
