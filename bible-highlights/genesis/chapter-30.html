<h1>Genesis 30</h1>

<p>Since 6÷3=2, the big 3 is made into the names of 3 groups of Jacob's sons. Two each of six of Jacob’s sons are born to the handmaids and to Leah. Rachel also has two children, but only one in this chapter. Leah’s daughter, Dinah, is included in pink. The first letter of each name is drawn to curve with the big 3.</p>
<p>You can remember which handmaid goes with which wife if you add a line at the bottom of the R for Rachel, it makes a B for Bilhah. If you add a line to the top of the L for Leah it makes a Z for Zilpah.</p>
<p>At the top the phrase “Don’t nap, God arrives in zealous (and dynamite) justice” is written. This mnemonic can help you remember the birth order names of 8 of Jacob's sons (7 from this chapter and Benjamin from chapter 35) along with his daughter in pink: Don’t - Dan, Nap - Naphtali, God - Gad, Arrives - Asher, In - Issachar, Zealous - Zebulun, (and Dynamite - Dinah,) Justice - Joseph, (Beware - Benjamin).</p>
<p>At the top left, Dan is written on the big 3. He is the 5th son born so the bottom of the 5 below his name is made into a heart with the top line made into a gavel for “judged” which is what Dan means. The shortened version “judge” is written.  The mnemonic for Dan, Don’t, is represented by a line drawn through the gavel and as a part of the left side line of the 5 for Don’t judge the heart, only the outward actions can be judged.</p>
<p>Since the mnemonic for Naphtali is Nap and he is the 6th son born to Jacob, a 6 is drawn with a man sleeping in the bottom. Naphtali means “wrestled” or “wrestling,” so the shortened version “wrestle” is used.  To wrestle someone you would be on the ground wrestling them, so you can think of this man on the ground wrestling someone, or wrestling in his sleep about something.</p>
<p>Since the mnemonic for Gad is God, a cloud with Jesus, the Father, and two angels are drawn to represent God. Since Gad means “a troop,” you can think of God with Jesus and all the angels as being quite a troop.  Gad also means “good fortune,” which can be associated with the good fortune of making it to Heaven and seeing God. Since Gad is the 7th son born to Jacob and 7 is thought to be the perfect number, a 7 is drawn coming across Jesus and the Father’s shoulders and going down their side to represent they are perfect like the number 7.</p>
<p>Since the mnemonic for Asher is arrive, and Asher means “happy,” you can think how happy it will be when Jesus, the Father, and all the angels arrive to the earth’s sky to pick up the people and take them to heaven. Since Asher is the 8th son, an 8 is drawn. The top of the 8 is made into a cloud that they will come in and the bottom of the 8 is made into the earth. Also 8 is the number for new beginning and means eternity in some languages, so you can think of the happy new beginning of eternity when they arrive and take you to heaven.</p>
<p>Since the mnemonic for Issachar is In and the way to pronounce Issachar is “is a car” with a soft “s,” a car is drawn below the name Issachar. One way you can remember how to pronounce his name is to think “is a car, not a truck.” Issachar is the 9th son born, a 9 is drawn pointing down to indicate you can get “in” a car. Since Issachar means “hire,” the car is made into a taxi cab (a hired car).</p>
<p>Since the mnemonic for Zebulun is Zealous, lines going up and out are drawn below Zebulun to represent being zealous or energetic. Since Zebulun is the 10th son, you can think of these lines as 1’s and the circles with the people in them as 0’s. Since Zebulun means “dwell” or “dwelling” the people are put in the circles in the midst of the zealous lines to represent dwelling in zeal. Also the people of God dwell in Zion, which can make you think of dwelling in Zebulun, since they both begin with a “Z” and end with an “n.”</p>
<p>Dinah is also born to Leah and her mnemonic is Dynamite, so some red sticks of dynamite are drawn under Dinah.</p>
<p>The big 0 is part of Joseph’s name, separated on a different number than the other sons because he was born to Jacob’s most loved wife, Rachel.</p>
<p>Since Joseph’s mnemonic is Justice, a gavel is drawn below Joseph along with a plus sign to represent “add” or “increaser,” the definition of Joseph. Since Joseph is the 11th son born to Jacob,  you can think of the gavel and the plus sign as making the shape of an 11. Since Joseph’s name is made with the big 0 of the number 30 which is made into a big cow, you can think of Joseph also as increasing or adding up to as much as this big cow.</p>
<p>The big 0 is the body of the speckled and spotted animals that God blessed and prospered Jacob with.</p>
<p>The heaven and earth book highlight is placed by ‘Joseph’ because he saves the people on the earth during the famine in Egypt.</p>
<p>To put all the sons together in this chapter and the one before, Benjamin’s name has been added to this picture and put in parentheses, though he is not born until chapter 35. Since Benjamin’s mnemonic is Beware, you can think of the little man and the arm with the right hand held up saying, “Beware.” Ben means “son” and jamin means “right hand,” and since Benjamin is the 12th son born to Jacob, the little 1 is made into a  man to represent “son” and the little 2 is made into an arm with the right hand up to represent “right hand.”</p>
