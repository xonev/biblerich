<h1>Song of Solomon</h1>
<p> - </p>
<p>treble clef with lily and rose </p>
<p>-“The s</p>
<p>ong</p>
<p> of </p>
<p>songs,</p>
<p> which is </p>
<p>Solomon</p>
<p>’s” 1:1, “I am the </p>
<p>rose </p>
<p>of Sharon, and the </p>
<p>lily </p>
<p>of the valleys.” 2:1</p>
<p>To remember Song of Solomon is in a garden, think of the flowers drawn on the treble clef.</p>
<p>(the treble clef is used because it makes a backwards S for Solomon & Song)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 8 chapters in Song of Solomon, the treble clef makes the shape of an 8)</p>
