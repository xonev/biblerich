<h1>1 Chronicles </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>1 roll scroll with 29</p>
<p> - “ And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah . . . are they not </p>
<p>written in the book of the chronicles</p>
<p> of the kings of Judah?” 2 Kings 20:20</p>
<p>(1 Chronicles is about the generations from Adam to king David, to help you remember this the 2 on the left can be made into a cursive A for Adam and the top of the 9 can be made into a D for David)</p>
<p>(1 roll scroll is drawn so you know you are in 1 Chronicles) </p>
<p>(to remember there are 29 chapters in 1 Chronicles, the ends of the scroll are made into a 2 and a 9, and the left side of the 9 can be thought of as the shape of a “C” for Chronicles)</p>
