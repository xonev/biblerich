<h1>Titus </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>family</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(husband, child & wife)</p>
<p> -  “To </p>
<p>Titus, mine own son</p>
<p> after the common faith” 1:4, “</p>
<p>husband </p>
<p>of one </p>
<p>wife</p>
<p>, having faithful </p>
<p>children</p>
<p>” 1:6</p>
<p>Since Paul also thought of Titus as his own son, and since husbands, children, and wives are mentioned in Titus, a husband, a child, and a wife along with the letters”us” are used as the highlight for Titus. You can thimk of Titus as a “tight” “us” family, a closely knit family, like God wants our fimilies to be.</p>
<p>(the father is made with the T for Titus, the child is made with the “i” in Titus, the wife is made with the “t” in Titus, and the “us” in Titus describe who these people are.</p>
<p>(to remember there are 3 chapters in Titus, 3 of the letters were made into the 3 people described in Titus)</p>
