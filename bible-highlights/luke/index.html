<h1>Luke - L U K E Man</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p> “And she brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manager.” 2:7,</p>
<p>“for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” 24:39</p>
<p>Luke is the 3rd of the 4 gospels and portrays Jesus as a Man. From birth to life after death, Jesus still has a body of a man as Luke tells us. A man is used for the highlight for Mark made out of the letters L-u-k-e.</p>
<p>(the nose of the man makes the L in Luke, the bottom of the face makes the “u” in Luke, the body and legs makes the “k” in Luke, and the hand going out makes the “e” in Luke)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 24 chapters in Luke the nose in the L shape can be the left line of a</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and the line going across as the</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and the shoulder and leg of the man can be made into a 2 for 24 chapters in Luke)</p>
