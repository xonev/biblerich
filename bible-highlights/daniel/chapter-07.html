<h1 id="daniel-7">Daniel 7</h1>

{% include picture-page-header.html %}
{% include media.html %}
<p>God used the man-made statue in Daniel 2 to portray future kingdoms. In this chapter, God portrays the kingdoms using unclean animals which He created. As in many other Bible chapters, 4’s and 7’s go together in this chapter.</p>
<p>On top of the big 7 are the 4 beasts that Daniel saw in this chapter. On the left is the Lion and the Leopard, and at the top right is the Bear and the Dreadful beast. The 1st letter of their names along with the sides of the crown form a 4. These 4 beasts represent the same kingdoms as those represented by the metal image in chapter 2.</p>
<p>"These great beasts... are 4 kings which arise out of the earth," is surrounded by paper and feather pen.</p>
<h2 id="the-lion">The Lion</h2>
<p>On the top left, the first beast Daniel saw was the Lion. In Jeremiah 4:7 (another 4 and 7 combination), God states, “The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant,” and in Jeremiah 50:43 and 44, “The king of Babylon... shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan...” These verses make it clear that Babylon is the lion. The boldness of Babylon is well represented by a lion. <em>Bold</em> is written in a gold color beside the lion’s head to help remember this kingdom is the head of gold in chapter 2.</p>
<p>The map below shows how the Babylonian kingdom had to cross the Jordan, as mentioned in Jeremiah, to conquer Israel. The blue line is the Jordan. The lion is drawn facing west -- the direction that Babylon traveled toward the Jordan. Babylon began its rule in
about 606 B.C. which is written beside the lion. <a href="/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-02.html">Go to chapter 2 to memorize the kingdom dates</a>.</p>
<p><img class='img-polaroid' alt="Lion to Jordan" src="/img/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-07-lion-map.png" /></p>
<p>The lion has eagle’s wings which represents the swiftness of Babylon's conquest. The eagle's wings can also call to mind the pride of Babylon. Next, Daniel sees the wings plucked up and the lion made to stand on his feet as a man. This symbolizes the ceasing of Babylon's conquest.</p>
<p>A man's heart was then given to the lion. This has 2 meanings. One is that men are weak, timid, scared, and faint-hearted against beasts, terrors, etc. Babylon became more fearful at the end of the kingdom when Belshazzar refused to fight the Medo-Persians but instead locked the gates to the city and held a feast. The second meaning is found in Jeremiah 17:9, “The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it?” Belshazzar did wickedness by attempting to drink wine out of the Lord’s vessels from the temple.</p>
<p>We have drawn the Jeremiah 4:7 and Jeremiah 17 references on the picture to easily remember them.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion in dates and times note that the Bible says Nebuchadnezzar is
Belshazzar’s father in chapter 5, but he was actually Belshazzar's grandfather. The Bible uses “father” to mean any ancestor. For example, Abraham is called our father. Nebuchadnezzar is the father of Nabonidus and Nabonidus is the father of Belshazzar. Belshazzar co-rules the whole time with his father, Nabonidus, who liked to catch butterflies. Note also that Nebuchadnezzar co-ruled for 2 years with his father Nabopolassar in chapter 1, which the Jewish reckoning does not count in chapter 2.</p>
<h2 id="the-bear">The Bear</h2>
<p>Drawn to the top right, the next beast Daniel saw was the Bear. The bear represents Medo-Persia. Medo-Persia is represented by a bear because the Medo-Persians were cruel and rapacious, robbers and spoilers of the people. The bear is colored silver to correspond to the arms of the statue in Daniel 2, which also represented Medo-Persia. To remember the character of this kingdom, the word <em>Robber</em> is written. The word is written in silver by the bear’s shoulders to again indicate the chest and arms from Daniel 2.</p>
<p>Daniel saw the bear raise itself up on one side which represented Persia being the stronger. The 3 ribs in its mouth symbolize the 3 territories it conquered. The map below shows how the silver colored kingdom of Medo-Persia moved to conquer Babylon, Egypt, and Lydia. The bear is drawn facing west -- the direction Medo-Persia traveled in its conquest of these kingdoms.</p>
<p><img class='img-polaroid' alt="Bear to Babylon, Egypt, Lydia" src="/img/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-07-bear-map.png" /></p>
<p>A mnemonic for the ribs is the acronym “BEL.” The B for Babylon, E for Egypt, and L for
Lydia. You can think of this acronym as a “Bell” that you can hang on the silver collar of a medium persian cat (for Medo-Persia), or the breast of the statue image in chapter 2, or on the neck of the bear in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="the-leopard">The Leopard</h2>
<p>Drawn to the left, the 3rd beast Daniel saw was a Leopard. Leopards are known for their strength and quickness. This is an appropriate representation of Greece, led by Alexander the Great -- well known for the speed with which he conquered the world at that time. Fast is written to represent Greece's character.  It is written by the belly and thighs of the leopard in brassy orange to recall the thighs of the statue from chapter 2.</p>
<p>The map below shows the kingdom of Greece in brassy orange and the direction Greece came from to conquer Medo-Persia. The leopard is drawn facing in that direction.</p>
<p><img class='img-polaroid' alt="Leopard to Medo-Persia" src="/img/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-07-leopard-map.png" /></p>
<p>The leopard was given 4 wings of a fowl to represent Greece's quickness to conquer. Two wings were not enough to represent the speed of its conquest. The 4 heads of
the leopard (and the 4 horns of the he-goat in Daniel 8) represent the 4 generals that ruled the 4 territories of Greece after Alexander the Great died. An easy way to remember these 4 generals is found <a href="/bible-highlights/daniel/greek-generals.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-dreadful-beast">The Dreadful Beast</h2>
<p>To the right, the last beast Daniel saw was the Dreadful Beast which represents Rome. It is described as dreadful and terrible, strong exceedingly, having iron teeth,
nails of brass, and diverse from all the beasts that were before it. God could find no beast in nature to represent this last kingdom. It was diverse from anything found in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>The unnaturalness fits Rome well with its unnatural love of oppression in the killing of Jesus and in the little horn power of the Roman Catholic church with its inquisitions and
persecutions. Unnatural is written to indicate the beast's character.  The word is written in black (for iron) beside the legs, feet, and toes of the dreadful beast to easily remember that the legs, feet, and toes of the statue in chapter 2 represent Rome.</p>
<p>The map below shows the Roman kingdom in black (for iron) and the
direction it came from (in red for the clay) to conquer the Grecian kingdom. The dreadful beast is drawn facing the direction of its conquest.</p>
<p><img class='img-polaroid' alt="Dreadful beast toward Greece" src="/img/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-07-beast-map.png" /></p>
<p>The 10 horns are the same as the 10 toes of Daniel 2. This is indicated to the right of the dreadful beast. An easy way to remember the 10 toes is found <a href="/bible-highlights/daniel/chapter-02-10-kingdoms.html">here</a>. The 10 horns represent the 10 kingdoms that
Rome divided into in 476 A.D. They were the Alamanni, Anglo-Saxons, Burgundians, Franks,
Heruli, Lombards, Ostrogoths, Suevi, Vandals, and Visigoths.</p>
<p>The 1 little horn that comes out of the 10 horn kingdom represents the Roman Catholic Pope which is indicated beside the dreadful beast. Little does not always mean small or tiny in the Bible. Matthew 5:19 says that whoever shall break God’s law and teach others to do so is called least in the kingdom of heaven, even though they may be great and powerful in this world. This made a kingdom that was different from the other kingdoms, in that the 10 kings were actually persuaded and ruled by the Roman Pope who caused the inquisitions and persecutions of God’s people.</p>
<p>Three horns were plucked up which means that they were conquered and are no more. They were the 3 kingdoms with the acronym “HOV,” for Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals. You can think of this acronym in the phrase, “they hov to go.” Some people think of the “HOV” lane in a busy city as their clue, which means “high occupancy vehicle” lane.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the 1 little horn that plucked up the 3 horns is the beast of Revelation 13. This is convenient because the 1 for the 1 horn and the 3 for the 3 horns together make the number 13. Iron teeth is written beside the beast to represent its unnatural persecuting character.</p>
<h2 id="the-judgment">The Judgment</h2>
<p>Since 7 is the perfect number, you can think of the 7 representing the perfect judgment of God for the judgment scene here in Daniel 7. A gavel made into the shape of a 7 represents this judgement scene with God, thrones and angels. It is placed in the middle of the seven to remind you that the 3 angels' message can be found in the middle of this chapter, “the hour of his judgement is come.”</p>
<p>The books were opened and Jesus is given His kingdom. He starts judging the names in the
books to determine who He will return to retrieve for His kingdom.</p>
<p>This scene has 10,000 times 10,000 angels around God. The 1s of the 10,000s are drawn as angels that make little 7s for chapter 7.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the big 7, the Dreadful beast had 1 little horn come up among the 10 horns. The man at the bottom of the big 7 represents the 4th king that is diverse from all the rest, that is, the Pope influencing the divided kingdoms. Here is the detail of what this little horn of the Dreadful beast would do. The arrow pointing to his mouth open represents a mouth speaking great things against the most high. The Popes spoke arrogantly and have even claimed to be God on earth. The arrow pointing to the whip represents warring with the saints through inquisitions and persecutions. The arrow pointing to his mind with the thought bubble symbolizes thinking to change the times and laws of God.</p>
<h2 id="times-and-laws">Times and Laws</h2>
<p>Throughout history, kings have changed times and laws. God, however, is only concerned with His times and laws. The law of God related to time is the 4th commandment -- to keep the 7th day holy. The Catholic Church claims that they transferred the solemnity of the Sabbath to Sunday, that they are above the Bible, and that this is their mark of authority. They only “think” they have changed it, because God never changed it. The arrow pointing to the man's open hand represents the saints being given into his hand for a time, times and the dividing of time. You can think of the “watch” also on the little man’s “hand” to remember the saints are given into his “hand” for a “time.” If something is “diverse” it would have to “change.” These words are written in red so you can correlate these two things. In this chapter the “diverse” 4th kingdom shall think to “change” God’s times and laws. "The diverse 4th kingdom thinks to change times and laws (of God)," is surrounded by script paper and feather pen.</p>
<p>At the bottom left, remember 7s and 4s go together, and see that Daniel 4 and Ezekiel 4 (and Numbers 14) contain the information needed to figure out what a “time” and a “day” are in Daniel 7’s prophecy. A time is a year, as we know from Daniel 4 and as is shown at the bottom left. So a time -- 1 year or 360 days -- and times -- 2 years or 720 days -- and the dividing of times -- half a year or 180 days add up to 3 1/2 years or 1260 days. Then, after applying Ezekiel 4 (and Numbers 14) which indicates a day is a year, we have 1260 years. This is how long the ruling and persecutions lasted. But the dreadful beast, in its horn form, still has power until Jesus returns.</p>
<p>The persecutions began in 538 A.D. Counting 1260 years brings us to 1798 A.D. This time period began in 538 A.D. and the rule of Medo-Persia began in 538 B.C. Therefore, we can use the same memory devices that we used in Daniel 5. Think of the 5 as the cup of wine held by the whore from Revelation 17. Think of the 3 as the "w" (for wine) turned on its side. For the 8, remember either "ate and drank" or "ate the people." The ending of the
persecution period was in 1798 A.D. when Berthier put the Pope in prison. Use the woman of Revelation 17 to remember this. Remember the picture of the woman sitting on 7 mountains and the 1 as an arrow pointing up to indicate 8 and 9. Then reverse the order of 8 and 9, and you'll have 1798 A.D.</p>
