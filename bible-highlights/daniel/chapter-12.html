<h1 id="daniel-12">Daniel 12</h1>

<p>Daniel 12 ends the visit of the angel to Daniel. The prophecy is about the end of probationary time. This probationary period ends when Michael stands up, and the time of trouble begins. The 1 and 2 of the big twelve are drawn into an image of Michael standing up from of a chair. The first verse states that Michael is "the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people." Therefore, a crown is drawn atop the chair to remind you of this. The one who stands for the people of God is Jesus, as stated in 1 Timothy 2:15, "There is . . . one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>When Michael stands up, the time of trouble begins. You can relate this to the "terrible 2s" (since chapter 12 has a 2 in it) or Jacob's time of trouble from Genesis 32 (drawn to the right of the big twelve).</p>
<p>This chapter is the 12th chapter, there are 3 time prophecies, and 4 words that start with "s" which go up. To remember this, just count from one to four (1, 2, 3, 4). This mnemonic is illustrated at the top right of the picture.</p>
<p>The four words that start with "s" are "stands," "sleep," "shut," and "shall." They are numbered across the page and shaded with gray. The word "stands" is found in verse 1 (so it's numbered with a preceding colon). Michael "stands" up in verse 1. The second word, "sleep," is found in verse 2 (so it's numbered with a preceding colon). The "sleep"ing awaken in verse 2. The other words which begin with "s" are in the fourth verse. The third word is "shut" -- Daniel is "shut" up; he is not to share the words of the vision. The fourth word is "shall" (and is numbered with a preceding colon since it's in verse 4). Knowledge "shall" increase.</p>
<p>The sleeping awaken in the second verse. This is represented by a 12 drawn into a pictorial representation of an eye transitioning from closed (everlasting contempt) to open (everlasting life).</p>
<p>The third verse says that the wise and those that turn many to righteousness will shine. This is drawn as a two turned into a star (they will shine) with people turning toward righteousness.</p>
<p>Daniel is told to seal the book until the end of time when knowledge increases and men run to and fro in the fourth verse. This is drawn as a twelve -- the 1 is drawn as Daniel sealing the book and the 2 is drawn as knowledge increasing and men running to and fro.</p>
<p>To remember that chapter 12 includes 3 time prophecies, just remember that the sum of 1 and 2 is 3.</p>
<h2 id="the-1260-year-prophecy">The 1260 Year Prophecy</h2>
<p>The first prophecy is the 1260 year prophecy -- from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D. -- the same dates as found in Daniel 7.  This is the period during which Rome, the king of the North (chapter 11) and the little horn (chapter 7), will have power over God's people to "scatter the power of the holy people" or to persecute them. These persecutions are what drove many Christians, such as the Pilgrims to escape to other countries, such as America. This time period began in 538 A.D. when the Ostrogoths abandoned their seige of Rome, allowing papal Rome to gain power. It ended in 1798 A.D. when the French general, Berthier, put the Pope in prison.</p>
<p>To help you remember that this period saw Rome "scatter the power of the holy people," a picture is drawn next to the prophecy of a person in a hole with a Bible in his hand. "Hole" sounds like "holy," so both the hole and the Bible should remind you that this chapter relates to the holy people.</p>
<p>The 1260 days are described as "a time, times, and a half." To remember that this prophecy is in chapter 12, a small 12 is drawn below "time, times and a 1/2." You can correlate 12 and 1/2 because they use the same digits.</p>
<p>There are several mnemonics to remember that this prophecy starts in 538 A.D. You can relate it to the 538 B.C. from Daniel 5 (when Medo-Persia began its rule), or you can use the mnemonics for Revelation 17 or Daniel 7, since all these prophecies are parallels of one another. One other mnemonic is to remember that the sum of 5 and 3 is 8.</p>
<p>To remember that the prophecy ends in 1798 A.D., you can use the following mnemonic. First, remember that the power who scatters is the harlot from Revelation 17 -- this gives us the first two numbers 17. Then think of the 1 as an up arrow to remind you to count up from 7 to 8 and 9 -- this gives us the last 2 numbers (89). Now flip the last two numbers, and we have our year -- 1798.</p>
<h2 id="the-1290-year-prophecy">The 1290 Year Prophecy</h2>
<p>The second prophecy is 1290 years -- from 508 A.D. to 1798 A.D. This has the same ending date as the first time prophecy, but begins 30 years earlier. This prophecy starts in 508 A.D. when "the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up." This occurred when the Roman Catholic church managed to make an ally of Clovis, the Barbarian king of the Franks, who defeated the Visigoths in 508 A.D. and provided needed military strength to Catholicism. The "daily sacrifice" that was taken away was that of the pagans, who were converted or forced to convert to the Catholic version of Christianity. The "abomination that maketh desolate" is papal Rome -- the Catholic church.</p>
<p>To remember 508 A.D., just remember the starting date of the 1260 year prophecy -- 538 A.D., and then remember that this was when pagans began to be eliminated -- there were 0 pagans and 0 sacrifices. Take the 0 and put it in the middle of the other date to get 508.</p>
<h2 id="the-1335-year-prophecy">The 1335 Year Prophecy</h2>
<p>The 1335 year prophecy also starts in 508 A.D. and ends in 1843 A.D. The year 1843 is when the books of Daniel and Revelation were "opened" and people started to gain understanding of the prophecies therein. This caused a world-wide awakening, which is why these people are counted as "blessed." Jesus also stated in Matthew 3:16, "Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear."  People believed that the cleansing of the sanctuary would occur at this time and that this was the same time as the 2300 year prophecy from Daniel 8. They later realized that the 2300 year prophecy actually reached its completion in 1844 because there is no year zero in the A.D./B.C. system. Therefore, they were counting a year that was not there.</p>
<p>To remember that the prophecy extends 1335 years, remember some of the words from the prophecy: "Blessed," "waiteth," "cometh," and "to." Then take the first letters of these words ("B," "w," "c," "t"). Then, notice that "B" looks like 13, "w" looks like 3 turned on its side, and "c" and "t" look like "5" when "c" is turned backwards and "t" is turned on its side and placed atop the backwards "c." Then you have 13, 3, and 5 to make 1335.</p>
