<h1>Exodus 20 - The 10 Commandments</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>
The top right hand corner of the picture page has the picture of Exodus Chapter 20 so you can
see that the 10 commandments are the details of when God spake the commandments to the
people. The little picture at the top of the little 2 is a mouth speaking, representing God
speaking.
</p>
<p>
The little 0 is for the 10 Commandments with 2 commandment stones drawn inside.
</p>
<p>
The black lines on the sides of the commandments represents the people saying they did not want
to hear God, lest they die.
</p>
<p>
The bottom of the little 2 represents the altar rocks that were not to be hewn (cut) and the line
represents the altar with no steps.
</p>
<p>The 1 represents the 1 and only God. </p>
<p>The circle at the top of the 2 is an image and the bottom of the 2 is a person bowing to the image, this not do. </p>
<p>The 3 makes lips that are speaking God’s name, not in vain. </p>
<p>The top of the 4 is the reason God gives to keep the Sabbath holy because God worked for 6 days and then rested on the 7th day. This is illustrated by making the middle of the 4 into a bed for resting.  The bottom of the 4 also happens to make a 7, so it is highlighted in purple to help illustrate the 7th day Sabbath of God. God made heaven and earth in 6 days, since the sun and moon were created on day 4 it makes it nice to use as a correlation. (drawn from the picture of Genesis 1 - creation days). </p>
<p>The top of the 5 has 2 point, so the father and mother are put here. Think of the line going up to it on the 5 as honoring or looking up to your father and mother. The bottom of the 5 is the land that the Lord giveth thee drawn as the earth and you will have long days upon it is the arrow going around the earth. </p>
<p>The top of the 6 can be thought of as a sword and the bottom of the 6 as a head for not kill. </p>
<p>The 7 can be thought of as the Revelation 17 picture about the harlot which makes you think of not committing adultery. </p>
<p>The 8 can be thought of as coins for not stealing. </p>
<p>The 9 can be a caption sign drawn on cartoons where he is speaking lies or making up a wild story (represented by the * and swirly 9 shapes). </p>
<p>The 1 of the 10 can be thought of as a man thinking with the circles getting bigger to the 0 of the 10 being his thoughts of wanting other people’s house, wife, and animals.</p>
