<h1>Obadiah - House Up In Rock Mountain, Petra</h1>

<p class='lead'>“The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom (Esau) .  .  . Though thou dwellest in the clefts of the rock . . . Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down” 1:1, 3, 4</p>
<p>Esau’s descendants are Edom which built their houses in these rose colored rock mountains and Esau’s hair was red, so you can easily remember this book is about Esau’s descendants (Edom) when you remember this red rock picture.</p>
<p>(the rock mountain is in the shape of an O for Obadiah)</p>
<p>(to help you remember there is only 1 chapter in Obadiah, you can think there is only 1 eagle in this picture and the verse also only mentions 1 eagle)</p>
<p>(Obadiah is the 4th book of the O’s and has the circle O’s of the rock mountain, also we think of rocks in the shape of O’s, and the circles of the stars)</p>
