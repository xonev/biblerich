<h1>Galatians </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>2 swords, 2 shields & land </p>
<p>- “Unto the churches of </p>
<p>Galatia</p>
<p> . . . If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be </p>
<p>accursed</p>
<p> . . .  how that beyond measure I </p>
<p>persecuted</p>
<p> the church of God and wasted it” 1:2, 8, 13, “when Peter was come to Antioch, I </p>
<p>withstood</p>
<p> </p>
<p>him to the face</p>
<p>, because he was to be </p>
<p>blamed</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p> I am </p>
<p>crucified</p>
<p> with Christ, nevertheless I live” </p>
<p>2:11, 20, “O foolish Galatians, who hath </p>
<p>bewitched</p>
<p> you . . . </p>
<p>Cursed</p>
<p> is every one that </p>
<p>hangeth on a tree”</p>
<p> 3:1, 13, “ye would have </p>
<p>plucked out your own eyes</p>
<p>, and have given them to me” 4:15, “the works of the flesh are . . .</p>
<p>witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife” </p>
<p>5:19&20</p>
<p>The encyclopedia says the Galatians were always warlike and since Galatians sounds like gladiators (fighters), 2 sword with 2 shields are used for the highlight of Galatians. </p>
<p>Paul wrote the Galatians in response to opponents trying to convince them they had to be circumcised to be saved.</p>
<p>Also the 2 shields look like a bewitching pair of eyes to help remember the familiar verses about bewitched, witchcraft, & plucked out eyes. </p>
<p>Galatians is the book that people deduct Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” </p>
<p>from 2 Corinthians 12</p>
<p> was poor eye sight, from the plucked out eyes they wanted to give Paul in Galatians chapter 4 and “how large a letter I have written unto you” in Galatians chapter 6, so the 2 shields as eyes is helpful.</p>
<p>Galatians is the 4th of the 9 books written by Paul to a group of people in a place, Galatia, with the book so named, so land is drawn under the swords.</p>
<p>(the left side of the sword and shield can be made into a G for Galatians, the circles can be made into the “a’s” in Galatians, the top of the two swords can be made into the “l” and the “t” in Galatians)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 6 chapters in Galatians the left side of the sword and shield can be made into a 6 for 6 chapters in Galatians) </p>
