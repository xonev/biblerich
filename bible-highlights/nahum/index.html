<h1>Nahum </h1>
<p>the Elkoshite</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>affliction shall not </p>
<p>rise up</p>
<p> the second time.” 1:1, 9</p>
<p>You can think “high rise” and “rise up” are very similar in order to remember affliction not rising up the second time is in Nahum.</p>
<p>(the up and down lines of the high rise buildings of the city of Neneveh almost spell out Nahum with four of the letter, N-h-u-m, having up and down lines; and if you use a capital A for the A in Nahum it fits well in there, too)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 3 chapters in Nahum, the picture has 3 of the high rise buildings taller and skinnier than the others)</p>
