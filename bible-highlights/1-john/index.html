<h1>1 John </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>1 curved heart</p>
<p> -”God is </p>
<p>love</p>
<p> ” 4:8. 16</p>
<p>Since John is the beloved disciple and John speaks about love so much in his writings, a curved heart with eyes, arms and legs is used as the highlight for 1 John.</p>
<p>(the curved left or right side of the heart can be made into an upside down J for John)</p>
<p>(there are two ways to remember there are 5 chapters in 1 John - 1. If you draw a circle around the heart it can make the bottom half circle of a 5 for 5 chapters in 1 John, and 2. The next two books of John’s, 2 & 3 John, have the numbers 2 and 3, if you add them together 2+3=5, they are so loving they go together and share their numbers with 1 John who only has 1 number with his name, so he gets their 5 numbers for 5 chapters in 1 John)</p>
