<h1>1 Peter - 1 Stone</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>”Simon, whom he also named</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>” Luke 6:14</p>
<p>Since Jesus renamed Simon to Peter, which means a stone, 1 light green stone is used for the highlight for 1 Peter.</p>
<p>(the circle of the stone can make the top circle of a P for Peter)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 5 chapters in 1 Peter the circle of the stone can be made into the bottom half circle of a 5 for 5 chapters in 1 Peter)</p>
