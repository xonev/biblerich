<h1>1 Peter </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>1 stone</p>
<p> -”Simon, whom he also named </p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>” Luke 6:14</p>
<p>Since Jesus renamed Simon to Peter, which means a stone, 1 light green stone is used for the highlight for 1 Peter.</p>
<p>(the circle of the stone can make the top circle of a P for Peter)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 5 chapters in 1 Peter the circle of the stone can be made into the bottom half circle of a 5 for 5 chapters in 1 Peter)</p>
