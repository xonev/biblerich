<p>“The word of the LORD that came to</p>
<p>Micah</p>
<p>the Morasthite” 1:1, “But thou,</p>
<p>Bethlehem</p>
<p>Ephratah . . .</p>
<p>out of thee</p>
<p></p>
<p>shall he come</p>
<p>. . . that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” 5:2</p>
<p>(the left and right sides of the house can make the left and right side of an M for Micah  then if you connect the top of the lines to the top of the door it will make the point for the middle point of the M for Micah and for Matthew which tells about the star the wise men saw over the house in Bethlehem)</p>
<p>(also, you can use the left side line of the house for the bottom of the i in Micah and the star can make the dot for the i in Micah)</p>
<p>(the top of the roof makes a leaning over 7 for 7 chapters in Micah, you can think of this perfect number 7 as the angel and God watching over the house where Jesus lived in Bethlehem)</p>
