<h1>1 Kings</h1>
<p> - </p>
<p>2 jewel crown</p>
<p> -“And Zadok the priest. . . anointed Solomon. . . and all the people said, God save </p>
<p>king</p>
<p> Solomon.” 1:39 </p>
<p>(a “K” for kings can be drawn by making the left side of the “K” as the bottom of the crown and the 2 lines going out as the points of the top of the crown)</p>
<p>(1 Kings is about the kings from Solomon to Ahab, and the left side line of the crown  can be made into a S for Solomon and the right side line of the crown can be made into an A for Ahab)</p>
<p>(to remember you are in the book of 1 Kings, 1 crown is drawn) </p>
<p>(since the first of 1 Kings, Adonijah tries to be king, you can make an A for Adonijah out of the lines of the 1st point on the crown, which makes 1st kings with a lot of A’s so it is easy to remember) </p>
<p>(to remember there are 22 chapters in 1 Kings, the left side of the crown is drawn in the shape of a 2 and the right side is drawn in the shape of a backwards 2 for 22 chapters) </p>
<p>(the 2 jewels also represent the 22 chapters) </p>
<p>(the 2 jewels change depending on what color the major king or kings are of that chapter)</p>
