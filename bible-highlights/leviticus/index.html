<h1>Leviticus - Wilderness  Sanctuary</h1>

{% include picture-page-header.html %}
{% include media.html %}
<p> “This is the sum of the tabernacle . . . as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the</p>
<p>Levites</p>
<p>.” Exodus 38:21</p>
<p>The Levites were to perform the ceremonies and</p>
<p>teach the law in the sanctuary</p>
<p>so it is the highlight of Leviticus.</p>
<p>(the left side line and the bottom line of the sanctuary makes an L for Leviticus)</p>
<p>(the 2 pieces of furniture in the court yard can be thought of for the 2 in 27 chapters of Leviticus and the top and right sides of the court make the shape of a 7 in 27 chapters in Leviticus)</p>
