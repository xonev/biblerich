<h1>Leviticus </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>wilderness</p>
<p> </p>
<p>sanctuary </p>
<p>- “This is the sum of the tabernacle . . . as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the </p>
<p>Levites</p>
<p>.” Exodus 38:21</p>
<p>The Levites were to perform the ceremonies and </p>
<p>teach the law in the sanctuary</p>
<p> so it is the highlight of Leviticus. </p>
<p>(the left side line and the bottom line of the sanctuary makes an L for Leviticus) </p>
<p>(the 2 pieces of furniture in the court yard can be thought of for the 2 in 27 chapters of Leviticus and the top and right sides of the court make the shape of a 7 in 27 chapters in Leviticus)</p>
