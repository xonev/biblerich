<h1>2 Peter </h1>
<p>- </p>
<p>2 stones</p>
<p> -”Simon, whom he also named </p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>” Luke 6:14</p>
<p>Since Jesus renamed Simon to Peter, which means a stone, 2 dark green stones are used for the highlight for 2 Peter.</p>
<p>(the circle of the stone on the left can make the top circle of a P for Peter and the circle of the stone on the right can be made into the circle of a lower case “e” for the “e’s” in Peter)</p>
<p>(to remember there are 3 chapters in 2 Peter the curved tops of the stones can make a sideways 3 for 3 chapters in 2 Peter)</p>
