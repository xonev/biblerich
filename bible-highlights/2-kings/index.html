<h1>2 Kings - 5 Jewel Crown &amp; Robe</h1>

{% include media.html %}
<p>“turn again unto the</p>
<p>king</p>
<p>and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?” 1:6</p>
<p>(a “K” for kings can be drawn by making the left side of the “K” as the bottom of the crown and the 2 lines going out as the points to the top of the crown)</p>
<p>(2 Kings is about the kings from Ahaziah to Zedekiah and the middle lines going to a point of the crown can be made into a A for Ahaziah and a Z for Zedekiah can be made with the shoulder line of the robe, the middle line going down and the bottom line of the robe)</p>
<p>(to remember you are in the book of 2 Kings, 2 kingly items are drawn 1. a crown and 2. a robe) (to remember there are 25 chapters in 2 Kings, think of the 2 kingly items - the crown and the</p>
<p>robe for the 2, and 5 jewels in the crown for the 5 and also the bottom line of the crown for the top line of a 5 and the whole robe for the bottom circle shape of a 5 for the 5 can be imagined) (the robe color changes, depending on the color of the major king or kings of that chapter)</p>
